Twice it seems that workers in the area think the containers belong on the sidewalk and move them there. One other time our trash was not picked up, though the rest of the block was done and I am assuming it was because the container was right next to a car that parked right next to it. Attached are images of a situation that happened this past week. I waited for the operator of the truck to return. He said that while the container was in front of the dip, it was easier for him to park once he moved the container. He felt it was fine to do because he was only parked there for 20 minutes. I guess he was claiming he was planning on putting on it back. There are other areas of the street with white paint marks making the parking spots. Can that be done in front of our house? Can marks be put on the street marking where trash containers go?",,

The driver could have accessed the blue can that was appropriately placed in the street, it he wasn't so lazy. I can say this because I have watched him countless times perform the same terrible lack of service throughout my neighborhood. I've seen cans missed and the entire contents of a can dumped onto the street and he just ignores it and drives away. Seriously. He's littering more than he is cleaning. My blood is boiling right now I am so angry. Please counsel this employee and then send him on his way if he can't perform his job at a satisfactory level at a minimum.",,

The water eventually does drain, but very slowly.  I hired Blue Planet Plumbing  to assess the situation.  They did a video assessment and wrote a report on the findings. Please see attached receipt and report. My plumber explained to me that this is a ""city"" stormdrain that connects to a major Storm drain artery behind my property.  You will also notice in my attached photos that the 12 inch pipe has become exposed and has a small piece missing.  My plumber says this can be repaired, but feels the city should assess first.

(just past Camino de la Reina) before crossing over the San Diego River.  It completely surprised me as the illumination in that area, close to an overpass for the trolley, is not very good.  The result is that I damaged both left tires (front and rear) and bent the left front wheel, which took the brunt of the impact.  I have run-flat tires, so I was able to drive home, which was a half-mile away.  I took my vehicle, a 2019 BMW 503i, to BMW of San Diego on Friday, March 26, and dropped it off for repairs.  The service advisor, Samuel Ketenjian, called me later that morning to advise that I would need two new tires, which were in stock, but the left front wheel would have to be replaced.  As the service center didn't have one in stock, one would have to be ordered.  Also, I would need an alignment.  The total bill is $1,786.00.",SS-032292-PV1,SS-032292-PV1

(just past Camino de la Reina) before crossing over the San Diego River. It completely surprised me as the illumination in that area, close to an overpass for the trolley, is not very good. The result is that I damaged both left tires (front and rear) and bent the left front wheel, which took the brunt of the impact. I have run-flat tires, so I was able to drive home, which was a half-mile away. I took my vehicle, a 2019 BMW 503i, to BMW of San Diego on Friday, March 26, and dropped it off for repairs. The service advisor, Samuel Ketenjian, called me later that morning to advise that I would need two new tires, which were in stock, but the left front wheel would have to be replaced. As the service center didn't have one in stock, one would have to be ordered. Also, I would need an alignment. The total bill is $1,786.00.",SS-018569-PV1,SS-018569-PV1

I asked the City to fix it and they did what is shown on the photo, except it was flatter to start with. I was told that's all what can be done.Now as you can see this sidewalk segment becomes more and more easy to trip and fall.

Central at sdpdcentral@pd.sandiego.gov,I think the county should use ten dollar littering ticket fines instead of 1000$ because people are always still littering even though it's 1000$ and if I was a cop I would feel to bad writing that expensive of a ticket because it could cause severe depression of someone but if they were ten dollar tickets then if I was a cop I would sit on La Jolla shores drive all day or any street and write ten dollar littering tickets all day. I think this would be a good use of the police force to help fight the littering pandemic? But I'm not sure if trash from this county gets thrown in the ocean or not but everyone needs to learn to recycle everything and make inventions for recycling all plastic and wrappers and items found on the ground as litter because this would help stop us from destroying the planet and food. Maybe ten dollar littering tickets is a good idea but 1000$ tickets is a bad idea bcs people are still littering. I'm not sure if this is a good idea.,SS-000030,SS-000030

I think the pillars could fall during the next floods this year or next year.

I received a call from an Officer Sanchez about the gentleman living in the RV on Camino Costanero. His voicemail indicated that he made contact with the gentleman and he claimed not to be living in the RV and to live in the neighborhood and was doing repairs and would move in 3 days. However, the RV arrived with three gentlemen at approximately 4 PM on Friday, April 2, and none of these men have been known to me as neighbors, nor have I seen any repairs occurring. Further, on Saturday, April 3 at approximately 5 PM when I submitted my second report, one of the gentlemen was eating at the kitchen table and when I went out to walk my dog, he saw that I saw him, ducked and closed the windows. The unit remains in the same spot as I have seen it, and submitted photos of, on an Camino Costanero since 4 PM on Friday, April 2. It is my understanding that RVs are not allowed to park on city streets overnight so the unit should not be allowed to stay there for 3 days, regardless of whether the inhabitant purports to be living in the unit or doing repairs. Officer Sanchez did not leave a return phone number and when I tried to call the number that he called me from back it would not except voicemails.

He defecates and urinates in the street and throws garbage all over the place. I have asked him to pick up his trash and he never does. I have gotten rats in my yard, which I have never had in my 2.5 years of living here. He also has approached me multiple times when I am walking my dogs in the evening and I do not feel safe walking here anymore. I believe he is physically and mentally disabled. He needs to get help. If he was just sleeping there and not causing any issues, I would not file a report, but the garbage is attracting rats and it is becoming a public health concern. Police sent him away a few months ago but he came back. I have also contacted my landlord about this, so you may be receiving another report. Thanks.",,

Just the other day, a couple fell just a couple feet away from my 19 month old.  I would like to have the trees taken down to protect my kids while they are playing in the back yard.  Is it possible to have these trees cut down?  Or confirm if they are my responsibility and I have permission to cut them down myself.  Thank you,",TR-RW-0121612,SS-012886

I have watched repaving go on all around San Diego in wealthier neighborhoods that did not even need repairs as I patiently waited for the city to honor its statement that my Street and neighborhood would be repaved last year. Yes my neighborhood is lower income with a high number of people of color and different cultural origins. As the city well knows that what is being done to us is called redlining which was made highly illegal many years ago. A local politician very recently stated publicly that all the funds have been appropriated to complete the repaving at my neighborhood yet nothing has been done.

At first I thought it might be kids playing with the street crossing buttons, but no. Frequently, when I'm approaching the intersection driving on OVHP at 45 MPH from either direction I'm greeted by a sudden yellow then red light--and the wait is excessive. It's as if the cross-street sensors are set too sensitive. It does appear that some road work had been done on the Del Sol side as the asphalt on the left-turn lane (northbound onto OVHP) is a patch. Maybe that's a clue for where to look at work history and start troubleshooting. Thank you.",SG-202080,SX-017247-002
